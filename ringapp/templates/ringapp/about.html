I started development of this project in mid 2013 after finding out about <b>Austin Mohr</b>'s site on topological spaces
(then called "Spacebook," now reincarnated as <a href="http://topology.jdabbs.com/">π-Base</a>). Thanks to Austin's
helpful advice (and a bit of a peek under the hood of the site) I began
dreaming of a site for rings that could track ring examples, their properties,
and have some logic on the back end to fill things out. The next major round
of thanks goes to <b>Derik Rhodes</b>, who set me up with a development environment
and sketch database in late 2013. I went on developing locally for a year while
I mustered the energy to learn about how and where I could make the page live.
This finally happened when I learned about <b>James Dabbs'</b> work with Austin
developing π-Base. Thanks to James' generous advice and encouragement,
this Database of Ring Theory is now finally able to make its debut on Heroku.
Thanks again for helping make this site a reality! --Ryan C. Schwiebert, December 2014
