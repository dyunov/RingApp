RingApp
=======

A database app for ring theory

The goal of the project is to function as a convenient example/counter-example reference for researchers and students of ring theory. 

http://ringtheory.herokuapp.com

Users can browse the examples of rings and the ring-theoretic properties that have been compiled. The examples are associated with the properties they do (and do not) have. The major feature is the ability to search the database for rings satisfying given ring-theoretic criteria.

In the near future, I hope to add a compilation of ring-related theorems and dependencies they might have. I also hope to find a way for users to submit forms of suggested additions to the information that already exists.
