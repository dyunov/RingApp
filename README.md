RingApp
=======

A database app for ring theory

The goal of the project is to function as a convenient example/counter-example reference for researchers and students of ring theory. 

https://ringtheory.herokuapp.com

Users can browse the examples of rings and the ring-theoretic properties that have been compiled. The examples are associated with the properties they do (and do not) have. The major feature is the ability to search the database for rings satisfying given ring-theoretic criteria.

If this project helps you in your publication, you can use the button in github to easily grab the citation data.
