## Are you looking to contribute data?
Please see the instructions on the [dart_data repository](https://github.com/rschwiebert/dart_data/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

These instructions cover contributions to the website code.

## How to Contribute

You'll need to [join GitHub](https://www.github.com/join/) to contribute.

### Open an Issue

If you are not familiar with the code, you can always [open an Issue](https://github.com/rschwiebert/RingApp/issues).
There you can report your proposed feature in detail, or the bug you encountered in detail, and the issue can be investigated.

### Make a Pull Request

To add a pull request implementing changes to the repository, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/about-forks/)
this project to your own account, make whatever changes you'd like, then
[open up all pull request for review](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

When evaluating a submission, a project developer will look for conformance with PEP-8 (and perhaps soon a Black compliant submission)

Once the PR is approved, a developer can go about integrating it into the master branch.
